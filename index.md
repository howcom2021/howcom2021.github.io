  Welcome to the first International Hands-on Workshop on Collaborative Modeling 2021 (HoWCoM).<br>
  HoWCoM is a completely online event co-located with the <a href="http://www.modelsconference.org">MODELS 2021</a> conference.

## Why HoWCoM?

The ability to collaboratively engineer models of systems has become a particularly important topic in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Apart from becoming multidisciplinary, engineering teams are also getting more and more distributed in space and time. The lack of physical presence forces engineers to rely on digital means of collaboration. Given the recent trends in the research and development of collaborative MDE tools, it is high time for their hands-on evaluation.

The rare opportunity, provided by the online format of the 2021 edition of MODELS, enables studying the dynamics of collaborative modeling endeavors in a realistic environment: with physically distanced participants forced to rely on means of collaboration provided by the tools under study.

## Who is HoWCoM for?

HoWCoM primarily aims to bring together two groups of the collaborative MDE landscape. <i>Tool builders</i>, who are wishing to evaluate their tools in a highly realistic setting; and the current or potential <i>users</i> of collaborative MDE tools in general. These two groups share the common goal of carrying out experiments within a properly established and controlled environment. Tool builders might also find this workshop a good opportunity to promote their tools.
HoWCoM is also open to researchers and practitioners with innovative ideas regarding collaborative MDE. See the [Program](program) and [call for papers](cfp) for more information.
