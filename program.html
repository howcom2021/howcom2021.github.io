<h1>Program</h1>

This is a full-day, fully online workshop, with two distinct parts.

<h3><b>I. Morning session: Presentations</b></h3>

<h3><b>II. Afternoon session: Hands-on sessions</b></h3>
We invite the participants to experiment with the collaborative modeling tools of their choice.
Tool developers are invited to support the hands-on session assigned to their tools by providing a supervisory presence, and preferably a brief tutorial before the session starts. We encourage participants to experiment with multiple tools in the afternoon.
We then ask the participants to evaluate their experience by completing an evaluation sheet.
No prior knowledge is required for the hands-on session: the morning talks and the brief tutorials should provide sufficient information to enable working with the tools. The experiments will be conducted in Zoom breakout rooms.

<h1>Post-workshop publication</h1>

We are planning to report the valuable data collected during the workshop, along with the lessons learned, in a journal publication (e.g., <a href="https://www.sosym.org/">SoSyM</a>, <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10009">STTT</a>, or <a href="http://www.jot.fm/">JOT</a>) soon after the workshop. Interested participants will be invited to co-author this publication.
