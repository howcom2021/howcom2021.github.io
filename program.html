<br/><h3><b>Break (14:30-15:00)</b></h3><br/>

<h3><b>II. Afternoon block: Hands-on sessions (15:00-18:00)</b></h3>
We invite the participants to experiment with the collaborative modeling tools of their choice.
Tool developers are invited to support the hands-on session assigned to their tools by providing a supervisory presence, and preferably a brief tutorial before the session starts. We encourage participants to experiment with multiple tools in the afternoon.
We then ask the participants to evaluate their experience by completing an evaluation sheet.
No prior knowledge is required for the hands-on session: the morning talks and the brief tutorials should provide sufficient information to enable working with the tools. The experiments will be conducted in Zoom breakout rooms.<br/><br/>

<b>Coffee break</b> (17:15-17:30)<br/><br/>

<b>Discussion</b> (17:30-18:00)<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Based on the responses to open-ended questions of the exit questionnaires.</li>
    <li>Reflections on the exercises and the workshop in general.</li>
    <li>Next steps.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Logistics</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Zoom is used as the hosting video conference platform.</li>
    <li>The main room serves as the lobby for entering the workshop as a visitor.</li>
    <li>Upon entering, visitors can record their tool preferences and their availability in a Google Spreadsheet.</li>
    <li>Upon meeting the requirements, a breakout room for a hands-on session will be created. The requirements are the following.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>There are enough visitors/participants to start the session.</li>
        <li>The visitors/participants are available for the entirety of the session.</li>
        <li>There are enough resources to host the session, i.e., tool/VM, host person.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The above process is managed manually with reasonable automation if possible.</li>
    <li>Observers might join the sessions, but cannot interact with the experiment.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Post-workshop publication</h1>

We are planning to report the valuable data collected during the workshop, along with the lessons learned, in a journal publication (e.g., <a href="https://www.sosym.org/">SoSyM</a>, <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10009">STTT</a>, or <a href="http://www.jot.fm/">JOT</a>) soon after the workshop. Interested participants will be invited to co-author this publication.
