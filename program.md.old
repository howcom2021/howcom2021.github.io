# Program

This is a full-day, fully online workshop, with two distinct parts.

### **I. Morning session: Presentations**
We will entertain a range of presentations in the form of lightning talks, vision paper presentations, and case paper presentations. After each talk, we will animate a Q&A discussion session. All talks will be recorded and published on the workshop website.



### *Accepted papers*

* *Towards Personalized Change Propagation for Collaborative Modeling.* Mohammadreza Sharbaf, Bahman Zamani and Gerson Sunyé <p>[Vision paper]</p>
* *MindMaps sans Frontières.* Dilshod Kuryazov, Florian Schmalriede, Christian Schönberg, Kevin Meyer and Andreas Winter.
* *Collaborative Modeling across Language Workbenches - a Case based on Jetbrains MPS and Eclipse Spoofax.* Samuel Noah Voogd, Kousar Aslam, Louis van Gool, Bart Theelen and Ivano Malavolta
* *Collaborative modeling and metamodeling with MetaEdit+.* Steven Kelly and Juha-Pekka Tolvanen
* *Towards Conflict-Free Collaborative Modelling using VS Code Extensions.* Rijul Saini and Gunter Mussbacher

### *Detailed program* - TBA

### **II. Afternoon session: Hands-on sessions**
We invite the participants to experiment with the collaborative modeling tools of their choice.
Tool developers are invited to support the hands-on session assigned to their tools by providing a supervisory presence, and preferably a brief tutorial before the session starts. We encourage participants to experiment with multiple tools in the afternoon.
We then ask the participants to evaluate their experience by completing an evaluation sheet.
No prior knowledge is required for the hands-on session: the morning talks and the brief tutorials should provide sufficient information to enable working with the tools. The experiments will be conducted in Zoom breakout rooms.

*List of tools available TBA*.


# Post-workshop publication

We are planning to report the valuable data collected during the workshop, along with the lessons learned, in a journal publication (e.g., [SoSyM](https://www.sosym.org/), [STTT](https://www.springer.com/journal/10009) or [JOT](http://www.jot.fm/)) soon after the workshop. Interested participants will be invited to co-author this publication.
